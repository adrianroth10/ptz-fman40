\section*{Focus}
This problem will in the image analysis part focus on two problems. How to perform a good stitching of multiple images and then in this stichted image have a pan-tilt-zoom (ptz) feature to look at different parts of the image. Another challenge is to get all this to work in C++ using openCV.
