\begin{abstract}
	A conventional PTZ-camera may have the risk at looking in the ''wrong direction at the wrong time'', when surveying fast-paced scenes, such as an ongoing soccer game. An alternative to this is to simultaneously survey the entire scene, stitch the image together, and then creating the PTZ-motion in software.

	In this report we describe and implement such a system. Results show that for still images, the PTZ-motion and stitching works really well. 
	When applied to snapshots from real uncalibrated cameras, results were not a good, but this might have do with poor calibration rather than the stiching and PTZ-implementation.
