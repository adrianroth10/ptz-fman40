Once upon a time there was a person filming another person. The movie had to be just right for it to be rewatched year after year with many laughs and tears to follow. But there was a problem. The other person, the one being filmed, was moving very fast here and there. The person filming was having trouble getting the pan, tilt and zoom of the camera correct or else something might be missed.
